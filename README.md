## About

The Sea Snakes group is designed for enthusiasts at all levels‚Äîfrom beginners to advanced programmers‚Äîto collaborate, share knowledge, and work on exciting Python projects. Whether you're interested in data science, machine learning, coastal modelling or coastal mapping (GIS), there's a place for you here!

## Getting Started

Python is a coding language for scientific programming - a great tool for coastal scientists and engineers to analyse metocean data, create informative graphics and build functions for improved workflows.

‚ÄúCoding‚Äù requires;

- A language: Python in this case,
- A coding environment that stores all the functions and modules used by Python,
- A code editor or interpreter where the user can write, edit and usually run the code (e.g. VS Code, Spyder, IDLE).

See [Code Setup](#code-setup) section for more details on how to setup your Python coding system.

Next steps:
1. **Explore the Repositories**: We have repositories for various topics including data science, machine learning, coastal modeling, and more.
2. **Join Discussions**: Each repository has a Discussions section where you can ask questions, share resources, and discuss topics with other members.
3. **Contribute**: Share your code, add to documentation, or take on a new learning challenge! Check out our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Learning Goals

Our goal is to create a supportive environment for:
- Learning Python fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Building hands-on projects
- Sharing best practices and code snippets
- Collaborating on interesting problems and challenges

## Getting Help

If you have questions about this group or any of the repositories, feel free to reach out in the Discussions tab or open an issue in the relevant repository.
