# Aus Sea Snakes

Welcome to the **Aus Sea Snakes**! üéâ

Aus Sea Snakes are a group of coastal scientists and engineers across Australasia who share Python code to learn together and enhance their programming skills.

## About

The Sea Snakes group is designed for enthusiasts at all levels‚Äîfrom beginners to advanced programmers‚Äîto collaborate, share knowledge, and work on exciting Python projects. Whether you're interested in data science, machine learning, coastal modelling or coastal mapping (GIS), there's a place for you here!

Our goal is to create a supportive environment for:
- Learning Python fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Building hands-on projects
- Sharing best practices and code snippets
- Collaborating on interesting problems and challenges

This community is aimed at PhD students and young professionals. The idea for the Sea Snakes community was conceived at the [AusYCSEC](https://www.ausycsec.com.au/) conference in 2024 after a few drinks were shared watching whales pass Snapper Rocks in Queensland, Australia. 

For a larger, more established resource for Python material related to coastal science: [SEA-PY](https://pyoceans.github.io/sea-py/). SEA-PY may be more appropriate for some users.

## Getting Started

Python is a coding language for scientific programming - a great tool for coastal scientists and engineers to analyse metocean data, create informative graphics and build functions for improved workflows.

### Coding

‚ÄúCoding‚Äù requires;

- A language: Python in this case,
- A coding environment that stores all the functions and modules used by Python,
- A code editor or interpreter where the user can write, edit and usually run the code (e.g. VS Code, Spyder, IDLE).

### Python setup

See [Code Setup folder](https://github.com/AusSeaSnakes/.github/tree/main/PythonSetup) for example Python coding setups used by Aus Sea Snakes members and how to re-create them on your PC.
To get started, you can also try [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/#) to run Python code without having to install Python on your PC.

### GitHub

We use *GitHub* to share code and start discussions. If you don't already have an account, please [sign up here](https://github.com/join).

### Get going!
1. **Explore the Repositories**: We have repositories for various topics including data science, machine learning, coastal modeling, and more.
2. **Join Discussions**: Each repository has a Discussions section where you can ask questions, share resources, and discuss topics with other members.
3. **Contribute**: Share your code, add to documentation, or take on a new learning challenge! Check out our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Getting Help

If you have questions about this group or any of the repositories, feel free to reach out in the Discussions tab or open an issue in the relevant repository.
